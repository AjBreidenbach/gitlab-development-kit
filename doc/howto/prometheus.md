# Using Prometheus with GDK

Testing the Prometheus integration with the GitLab Development Kit requires some additional components. This is because the Prometheus integration requires a CI/CD deploy on Kubernetes.

Because of this, you will need to either run a local Kubernetes cluster or use a service like the Google Container Engine (GKE).

Setting it up locally with [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) is often easier, as you do not have to worry about Runners in GKE requiring network access to your local GDK instance.

## Instructions for Minikube on (OS X)

### Install kubectl if you do not have it

Kubectl is required for Minikube to function. You will need to download it, and add it to your path.

```
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

### Install Minikube
```
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.17.1/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

## Install Xhyve

We need to install a VM in order to be able to use Minikube. Xhyve is one method, unless you have VMware Fusion or Virtual box installed.

```
brew install docker-machine-driver-xhyve
```

Follow any completion steps.

## Set Minikube to use Xhyve

Configure Minikube to use Xhyve as the VM driver.

```
minikube config set vm-driver xhyve
```

## Start Minikube

Starts minikube, running the first few containers with Kubernetes components.

```
minikube start
```

### Open Kubernetes Dashboard

Open the Kubernetes dashboard to ensure things are working, and you can use this for future troubleshooting.

```
minikube dashboard
```

### Launch Prometheus

Next we tell Kubernetes to launch an instance of Prometheus, and we provide configuration in the ConfigMap.

```
kubectl apply -f support/prometheus/prometheus-configmap.yml
kubectl apply -f support/prometheus/prometheus-svc.yml
kubectl apply -f support/prometheus/prometheus-deployment.yml
```

### Get Prometheus Service URL

Displays the URL to access the newly started Prometheus server. Browse to it to ensure it is operational.

```
minikube service --url prometheus
```

### Configure GDK to listen to more than localhost.

From the GDK root directory, create a host file to configure GDK to listen for more than just localhost. This will allow the Runner to connect to your GDK instance.

```
echo 0.0.0.0 > host
```

### Edit `gitlab.yml` to configure GDK to use your real IP not localhost.

We need to configure GDK to inform it of the real IP address of your computer. This is because GDK returns this information to the Runner, and if it is wrong, Pipelines will fail. You can get your IP address by running `ifconfig` or opening up Network Settings.

Open `gitlab/config/gitlab.yml` and change the `host: localhost` line to reflect your IP.

Once saved, restart GDK to apply this change.

> Note: you should now access GitLab by the external URL (e.g. http://192.168.1.1 not localhost), otherwise it may not work correctly.

### Create a Project

Now that we have GDK running, we need to go and create a project with CI/CD set up. The easiest way to do this, is to simply import from an existing project with a simplified `gitlab-ci.yml`.

Import `https://gitlab.com/joshlambert/hello-world.git`, to use a very simple CI/CD pipeline with no requirements. (It just spins up a hello-world container.)

### Edit `support/prometheus/gitlab-runner-docker-configmap.yml`
This file configures the Runner to talk to GDK, and we need to edit two sections of this file.

First, we need to replace the existing IP with your computerâ€™s real IP address.

Next, replace the registration token with the token for your project.

> Note: if your project's token contains uppercase characters, it will fail due to a bug in the Runner. You can manually set the token further down the CI/CD settings screen. Set it to all lowercase letters and numbers.

Save your changes.

### Deploy GitLab Runner - can view Pod logs to confirm it registered
```
kubectl apply -f support/prometheus/gitlab-runner-docker-configmap.yml
kubectl apply -f support/prometheus/gitlab-runner-docker-deployment.yml
```

### Run a Pipeline to deploy to an Environment
Now that we have a Runner configured, we need to kick off a Pipeline. This is because the Prometheus integration only looks for environments which GitLab knows about and have a successful deploy. To do this, go into Pipelines and run a new Pipeline off `master`.

You can validate the deploy worked by looking at the Kubernetes dashboard, or accessing the URL.

To retrieve the URL:
```
minikube service production
```

If the deploy failed, you may need to edit the project's runner token to not include capital letters. (See Note in the step above.)


### Configure Prometheus Service Integration
Finally we are ready to configure the Prometheus integration.. Go into Project Settings, Integrations, and select Prometheus.

Enter the Prometheus URL from the step above, and click Active. Save and test.

### View Performance metrics
Go to Pipelines, Environments, then click on an Environment. You should see a new button appearing that looks like a chart. Click on it to view the metrics.

>Note: It may take 30-60 seconds for the Prometheus server to get a few sets of data points.
